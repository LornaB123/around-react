# Around the U.S. React App

## Small webpage set up with CSS, HTML and JavaScript

This webpage has been set up using flexbox and grid layouts in CSS styling. The files are all sorted using BEM methodology for ease of locating components needed. The JavaScript functions are set up in a modular format with dedicated classes for each component, this makes for an easier to read and edit scripts. Webpack was used for bundling and building JavaScript files to be used in the browser.

## JS features

Currently popups for editing the user avatar, profile name and description, adding a card to the screen, and to view each card at a larger size are created and functional. Additional functionality needs to be added to link them to the server. The initial cards are pulled from an api server to create an interactive platform for the user.
